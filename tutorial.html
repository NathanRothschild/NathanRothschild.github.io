    <h4>Hello! Here is a short tutorial as to how you can make your map.</h4>
	  <p><br></p>
	  <p>Step 1: Go to <a href="https://maphub.net/register">MapHub.net</a> and create an account.</p>
	  <p><br></p>
    <p>Step 2: Go to "New Map", and on the right side, set Visibility to Public. This is imperative. You may need to verify your email for this. Then, click Save.</p>
	  <p><br></p>
    <p>Step 3: Add points to your map by clicking on the Point of Interest Icon on the left sidebar, and clicking where you want the point to be. You can also add a title, description, image, icon, or color to the point.</p>
	  <p><br></p>
	  <p>Step 4: After you have completed your map, click Save. Then, click on Map, and click on Link under Share. Copy that link. </p>
	<p><br></p>
	  <p>Step 5: Send an email to CA900070781@concordacademy.org with the Subject as "MapHub Link (Your Name)", and with the content solely being the MapHub link. </p>
	<p><br></p>
	  <p>You're done! Congratulations.</p>
